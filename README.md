## About The Project

Been trying to revamp my personal website to move away from the cookie cutter template that I used in college. The Big Idea here is the style of the page is very much inspired by websites like neopets of webkinz. Wanting the page to act like a world in one of those site. With the main animation there will be various hotspots to click leading to the various other pages of the sites and links to projects I have worked on. While still in progress on the animation side, the guts of the website have been laid.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
